Chat App (Convo)

Welcome to my Real time chat app! This app was created using React.js and Google Firebase.

React.js
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and efficient updates of the app's view.

Google Firebase
Google Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform. It provides a number of tools and services for building and maintaining applications, including authentication, database storage, and cloud functions. In this chat app, Firebase was used to handle authentication and store chat messages.

Thank you for using my chat app! I hope you enjoy the experience.
